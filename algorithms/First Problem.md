### The Stable Matching

As an opening topic, we need to prove that the boundary of time the problem takes, and the question as follow,
    Two genders, each one has preference list for all the other gender. How can we get the perfect matching?

- G-S(Gale Shapley) algorithm
    - unfairness
    - proven that,
        - most $n^2$ iterations 
        - algorithm returns a stable matching
        - yielding the same outcome 
        - unfairness
